# Archive - Development Files

This folder contains all the development iterations and experimental files created during the development of the Eye Disease Detection App.

## Files Overview

### Main Development Iterations

- `eye_disease_detector.py` - Initial version
- `eye_disease_detector_fixed.py` - First bug fixes
- `eye_disease_app.py` - Early app version
- `simple_eye_detector.py` - Simplified attempt
- `eye_detector_subprocess.py` - Subprocess approach

- `eye_detector_no_tf.py` - Version without TensorFlow
- `eye_detector_working.py` - Working iteration
- `eye_detector_demo.py` - Demo version
- `eye_detector_final_working.py` - Final working version (basis for app.py)

### Support Files

- `prediction_service.py` - Standalone prediction service
- `isolated_predictor.py` - Isolated TensorFlow script
- `minimal_predictor.py` - Minimal prediction implementation
- `predict_helper.py` - Prediction helper functions
- `debug_predictor.py` - Debugging utilities
- `launch_app.py` - Old launcher script

### Documentation

- `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - Development summary and solutions

## Purpose

These files represent the iterative development process to solve TensorFlow compatibility issues on macOS and create a working demonstration app. The final working solution was consolidated into `app.py` in the main directory.

## Note

These files are kept for reference and learning purposes. The production-ready application is in the main directory.
